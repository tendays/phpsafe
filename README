This is "phpsafe", a PHP code analyser based on a static type
system. It is designed to detect vulnerabilities caused by not
protecting untrusted data, such as cross site scripting, sql and shell
injection, use of uninitialised variables (which is a problem on
system where register globals *still* hasn't been turned off), etc.
